# quantum-tunneler

**Quantum-Tunneler** is a pure Rust implementation of a **Quantum-Safe IPSec protocol**, inspired by Aliro Technologies' approach to real-world post-quantum secure networking. The goal is to build a robust and extensible cryptographic stack for VPNs, embedded systems, and critical infrastructure, with native support for post-quantum cryptography.

## 🎯 Goals

- Implement a complete IPSec stack with IKEv2 key negotiation
- Integrate post-quantum cryptography using:
  - **Kyber512** (Key Encapsulation Mechanism)
  - **Falcon512** (Digital Signature Scheme)
  - **Dilithium3** (Digital Signature Scheme)
  - **SPHINCS+** (Digital Signature Scheme)
- Build a developer-friendly CLI for testing, simulation, and tunnel management
- Design for `no_std` compatibility targeting IIoT and embedded systems

## ✨ Technical Highlights

- 100% Rust-based implementation
- Modular architecture using Rust workspaces and crates
- Focused on security, testability, and clear documentation
- Ready for benchmarking, simulation, and audit scenarios
- Multiple post-quantum cryptographic primitives
- Generic cryptographic interfaces for easy algorithm switching

## 💡 Motivation

With the rise of quantum computing, traditional cryptographic methods such as RSA and ECC are becoming vulnerable. This project aims to proactively address this threat by exploring practical and secure quantum-safe networking strategies.
