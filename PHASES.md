- [x] Create initial CLI with basic `init` command
- [x] Write base documentation (README, architecture, phases)
- [x] Prepare `no_std` compatibility via feature flags

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 2 ‚Äì Post-Quantum Cryptography Integration (completed)
- [x] Implement Kyber512 (Key Encapsulation Mechanism)
- [x] Implement Falcon512 (Digital Signature Scheme)
- [x] Implement Dilithium3 (Digital Signature Scheme)
- [x] Implement SPHINCS+ (Digital Signature Scheme)
- [x] Provide generic crypto interfaces (traits)
- [x] Add unit tests with official test vectors
