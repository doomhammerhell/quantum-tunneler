This roadmap outlines the planned development phases for the `quantum-tunneler` project.

---

## ✅ Phase 1 – Planning and Architecture (completed)
- [x] Set up workspace with modular crates
- [x] Define core modules: crypto, ike, ipsec, utils
- [x] Create initial CLI with basic `init` command
- [x] Write base documentation (README, architecture, phases)
- [x] Prepare `no_std` compatibility via feature flags

---

## ✅ Phase 2 – Post-Quantum Cryptography Integration (completed)
- [x] Implement Kyber512 (Key Encapsulation Mechanism)
- [x] Implement Falcon512 (Digital Signature Scheme)
- [x] Implement Dilithium3 (Digital Signature Scheme)
- [x] Implement SPHINCS+ (Digital Signature Scheme)
- [x] Provide generic crypto interfaces (traits)
- [x] Add unit tests with official test vectors

---

## ✅ Phase 3 – IKEv2 Protocol Implementation (completed)
- [x] Implement IKEv2 Phase 1 (Main Mode)
  - [x] SA_INIT exchange
  - [x] AUTH exchange with post-quantum signatures
- [x] Implement IKEv2 Phase 2 (Quick Mode)
  - [x] CHILD_SA negotiation
  - [x] Key derivation using Kyber
- [x] Implement Security Association management
  - [x] SA database
  - [x] SA lifetime management
  - [x] Rekeying procedures

---

## ⏭️ Phase 4 – IPSec ESP Implementation
- [x] Implement ESP header processing
- [x] Implement tunnel mode encapsulation
- [x] Add replay protection
- [x] Implement packet authentication
- [x] Add SA and security policy management
- [x] Implement packet fragmentation handling

---

## ⏭️ Phase 5 – CLI & Monitoring Interface
- [ ] Add CLI commands:
  - [ ] `connect` - Establish VPN tunnel
  - [ ] `status` - Show tunnel status
  - [ ] `simulate` - Run attack simulations
  - [ ] `benchmark` - Performance testing
- [ ] Support multiple sessions
- [ ] Add real-time tunnel monitoring
- [ ] Implement JSON output format
- [ ] Add structured logging

---

## ⏭️ Phase 6 – Benchmarking & Stress Testing
- [ ] Performance evaluation:
  - [ ] Handshake speed
  - [ ] Tunnel throughput
  - [ ] CPU/memory usage
- [ ] Security testing:
  - [ ] MITM attack simulation
  - [ ] Replay attack testing
  - [ ] Forward secrecy verification
- [ ] Comparison with classical IPSec:
  - [ ] RSA/ECDH performance
  - [ ] Security guarantees
  - [ ] Resource usage

---

## ⏭️ Phase 7 – Packaging & Publishing
- [ ] Publish core crate to `crates.io`
- [ ] Generate API documentation via `docs.rs`
- [ ] Release open-source version on [GitHub](https://github.com/doomhammerhell/quantum-tunneler)
- [ ] Publish technical articles
- [ ] Create example applications

---

## 🔮 Beyond
- [ ] QUIC protocol integration
