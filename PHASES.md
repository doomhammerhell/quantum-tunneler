# Development Phases ‚Äì quantum-tunneler

This roadmap outlines the planned development phases for the `quantum-tunneler` project.

---

## ‚úÖ Phase 1 ‚Äì Planning and Architecture (completed)
- [x] Set up workspace with modular crates
- [x] Define core modules: crypto, ike, ipsec, utils
- [x] Create initial CLI with basic `init` command
- [x] Write base documentation (README, architecture, phases)
- [x] Prepare `no_std` compatibility via feature flags

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Phase 2 ‚Äì Post-Quantum Cryptography Integration
- Implement Kyber (Key Encapsulation Mechanism)
- Implement Falcon (Digital Signature Scheme)
- Provide generic crypto interfaces (traits)
- Add unit tests with official test vectors

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Phase 3 ‚Äì IKEv2 Protocol Implementation
- Handle both Phase 1 and Phase 2 of IKEv2
- Integrate key negotiation using Kyber/Falcon
- Store Security Associations in memory (heapless)

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Phase 4 ‚Äì IPSec ESP Implementation
- Implement encapsulation using ESP (tunnel mode)
- Manage SAs and security policies
- Add replay protection and authentication

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Phase 5 ‚Äì CLI & Monitoring Interface
- Add CLI commands: `connect`, `status`, `simulate`, `benchmark`
- Support multiple sessions and real-time tunnel info
- JSON output and structured logs

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Phase 6 ‚Äì Benchmarking & Stress Testing
- Evaluate handshake speed and tunnel performance
- Simulate MITM and replay attacks
- Compare with classical IPSec (RSA/ECDH)

---

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Phase 7 ‚Äì Packaging & Publishing
- Publish core crate to `crates.io`
- Generate API documentation via `docs.rs`
- Release open-source version on [GitHub](https://github.com/doomhammerhell/quantum-tunneler)
- Publish tech article (Medium, Hackernoon, etc.)

---

## üîÆ Beyond
- QUIC protocol integration
- MicroVM (Firecracker) secure tunnel hosting
- Web dashboard UI
- WireGuard-style performance profile
